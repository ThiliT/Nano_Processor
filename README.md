------------- 4-bit Nano processor : Group 46 --------------- 

* This is the 4-bit nanoprocessor which is developed using Xilinx Vivado software.

* This nanoprocessor is programmed to calculate the total of all integers between 1 and 3.

* You can use the push button 'U18' to reset the program at anytime. It will restart to execute the program.

* The result of the addition operation will be displayed on one of the 7 segments display of Basys3 board.

* According to our instructions it will display 0,3,5 and 6 on the 7 segments display respectively. (; 0+3=3, 3+2=5, 5+1=6 )

* The binary representation of the result (; i.e. R7) can be observed by the LEDs U16,E19,U19 and V19.

* The overflow flag is set to LED L1. It will light up when there is an overflow from the 4-bit Add/Subtract Unit.

* The zero flag is set to LED P1. It will light up when the inputs to the 4-bit Add/Subtract Unit are zero.
